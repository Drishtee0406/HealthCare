# HealthCare

This repository contains multiple **AI-driven healthcare analytics projects** developed using Python and machine learning. Each project focuses on early detection, risk analysis, and prediction of specific medical conditions using structured datasets and statistical models.


## Early-Stage Diabetes Prediction
- Classification models to identify patients at risk of early-stage diabetes.
- Techniques: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Association Rule Mining.
- Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Mlxtend.


---

###  Fistula Detection Analysis
- Predictive modeling using clinical survey data of fistula surgeries.
- Includes data cleaning, EDA, model building, and evaluation.
- Tools: Jupyter, Scikit-learn, Seaborn.

---

###  Chronic Disease Prediction *(Coming Soon)*
- Exploratory modeling for identifying patients at risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension or kidney disease.
- Planned methods: Decision Trees, SVM, Ensemble models.

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub
- **Optional**: Mlxtend, Flask (for deployment), Streamlit

## Motivation

This repository was born out of a personal desire to bridge the gap between data science and healthcare. Having witnessed close friends struggle with diseases like fistula and diabetes, I realized the potential for AI to support **early detection** and **clinical decision-making**. These projects reflect my academic journey and passion for applying technology to real-world health problems.
