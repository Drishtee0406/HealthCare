# Early-Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction

This project leverages machine learning and AI techniques to predict the likelihood of early-stage diabetes in patients, based on clinical features. It is part of the broader **HealthCare** repository, which includes data-driven health analytics projects built using Python.

## Project Objective

To build a predictive model using a clinical dataset that identifies individuals at risk of developing early-stage diabetes. The project also includes association rule mining to uncover hidden patterns among symptoms.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Mlxtend (for Association Rules)

## Features Engineered

- Glucose level
- Polyuria
- Polydipsia
- Sudden weight loss
- Weakness
- Visual blurring
- Genital itching
- Irritability
- Delayed healing
- Partial paresis
- Muscle stiffness
- Alopecia
- Obesity
- Age

## Models Explored

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machines

## Results

- **Accuracy Achieved**: ~95%
- **F1 Score**: High across most models
- **Association Rules**: Strong relation found between *Polyuria*, *Polydipsia*, and *Weight Loss* as frequent early signs
