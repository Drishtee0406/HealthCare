# Fistula Analysis – Annual Fistula Repair Survey Data

## This project is personal. My closest friend was diagnosed with fistula, and I witnessed the enormous physical pain and emotional anguish that it brought on her life for myself. From long recovery periods to social shame and delayed diagnosis, her experience made me appreciate how early detection and evidence-based treatment might be able to make a real difference.

## That realization led me to take on this project — to explore the possibility of AI and machine learning assisting in early detection and awareness of fistula cases. I hope this effort contributes something, no matter how small, toward work that makes lives easier and more accessible to timely care.

This project analyzes data related to **annual fistula repair surgeries**, aiming to uncover patterns, insights, and trends in medical outcomes using Python-based data analysis. It is part of the HealthCare repository focused on AI-driven medical insights.

##  Project Objective

To perform data cleaning, exploration, and statistical analysis on fistula repair survey data. The goal is to assist in understanding frequency, demographics, outcomes, and anomalies within surgical records.

##  File Overview

- `Fistula_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with complete data analysis pipeline.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Key Steps in the Notebook

- Importing and cleaning raw dataset
- Handling missing values and formatting
- Exploratory data analysis using:
  - Frequency plots
  - Crosstabs
  - GroupBy statistics
- Correlation analysis and insights on patient demographics

##  Results

- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 92% on the validation dataset.

##  Insights & Outcomes

- Identified most frequent patient demographics for fistula repairs
- Explored surgery success trends year-wise
- Discovered patterns related to hospital-wise surgery count and outcomes

##  Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Use Case

This project supports medical researchers and institutions by surfacing data-driven insights into fistula treatment trends, aiding future resource planning and treatment improvements.
